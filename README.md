# NoLHS
This small php script converts Literate Haskell files to plain Haskell equivalents.

##How to use it
NoLHS contains two programs. Each of both programs convert either LHS to HS or the other way around.
Write the short line into your command line. Note that you have to provide two arguments: the input and output file.

### LHS to HS
```
php lhs2hs.php input.lhs output.hs
```

### HS to LHS
```
php hs2lhs.php input.hs output.lhs
```
